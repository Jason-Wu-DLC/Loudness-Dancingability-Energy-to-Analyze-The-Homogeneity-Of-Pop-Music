# Loudness-Dancingability-Energy-to-Analyze-The-Homogeneity-Of-Pop-Music

# This project analyzes the homogeneity of pop music from 1970 to 2020 using metrics such as loudness, dancingability, and energy. By leveraging data scraping, Spotify API, and data visualization, the project explores trends and correlations in pop music over the decades.

# The workflow begins by scraping Billboard Hot 100 data for each year. Then, Spotify track IDs are retrieved for each song, and audio features such as danceability, energy, and loudness are extracted. The data is cleaned and analyzed for statistical trends, correlations, and insights. Visualizations provide a clear understanding of how these attributes have evolved over time.

# Key scripts include 01-scraping.py for data collection, 02-gettrackid.py and 03-getaudiofeatures.py for Spotify data integration, and 04-cleaning.py for preprocessing. Results are visualized using 07-danceability_all.py, 08-energy_all.py, and 09-loudness_all.py.
